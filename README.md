# Abstract
Exploring the attributes of the rapidly evolving green bond market is crucial for directing capital towards projects that mitigate climate risks and facilitate adaptation to environmental changes. To address the limitations of traditional bond matching-based spread methods, we propose a novel approach to compute green bond spreads based on yields to maturity and their term structure. We then analyze the key attributes related to the magnitude and sign of these spreads, as well as their consistency over time. Based on California's green municipal bond market, we find that these two types of green bond spread are on average positive and disparate but reach negative territories and converge after 2022. We identify structuring attribute associations of these spreads using a Bayesian machine learning approach, namely Association Rule Learning. Positive (and extreme positive) spreads based on tenor-specific information are associated with attributes such as tax status, pricing strategy, and maturity, while negative spreads are typically associated with a more complex interaction of attributes, including spread and yield on issuance, and callability. Spreads embedding information from the yield curve term structure are associated with attributes such as duration, maturity, and callability. Sector-specific differences in credit ratings, issue sizes, and use of proceeds have also been identified. The distinctive structuring attributes of these two types of spreads highlight the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of green bond spreads and offer practical insights regarding green bond screening to inform investment and diversification strategies, and policy decisions for sustainable portfolio management.
